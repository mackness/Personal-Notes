# linked list

a linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. In a singly linked list each node points to the next node. In a doubly linked list each node points to the next node and the previous node.

linked lists do not provide constant access time to a particular node / index within the list. this means that if you want to find the Nth element in the list you need to iterate over N elements 

the benefit of a linked list is that you can add and remove elements from the beginning of the list in constant time which can be useful in specific situations
